Hello, this is my portfolio website, it shows all of my personal javascript projects as well as a REST api backend.
The newest projects are on the top and the oldest projects are on the bottom.
Some features may be not working occasionally as this is not a commercial project,
occasionally I might not have the funds to pay for the backend, implemented a feature and push it before adjusting the UI to work with mobile or leave a major and minor bug due to the lack of testing.
